export const FAQ_ITEMS: FaqItem[] = [
  {

  },

    question: "Do I need any architecture or design background?",
    answer: "Not at all. These books are written for absolute beginners. Every concept is explained with diagrams, dimensions, and real examples."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the designs relevant to modern apartments and homes?",
    answer: "Yes—the books cover standard home sizes, modern layout principles, climate considerations, and space optimization techniques specifically for contemporary living."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I get updates if new content is added?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You get free lifetime updates. As design trends evolve and new materials become available, we update the books and you receive the new versions at no extra cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use these books for commercial projects?",
    answer: "Yes. Architecture students, developers, and design consultants all use these as practical references. The clearance charts, dimension guides, and material recommendations apply to both residential and commercial interiors."
